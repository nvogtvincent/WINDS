# WINDS Validation
This repository contains the scripts used to produce the figures in Vogt-Vincent & Johnson, *Multidecadal and climatological surface current simulations for the southwestern Indian Ocean at 1/50Â° resolution* (in review). The repository also contains certain files used to run the simulation, but please note that WINDS output is *not* stored here. WINDS output can be downloaded for free at the British Oceanographic Data Centre through CEDA, see [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/b2b9bfe408f14ea7a79d9ff7aee0d0b8) for WINDS-C, and [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/BF6F0CFBD09E47498572F21081376702) for WINDS-M.
